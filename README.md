### My visions for the project
- An app that can remind its users on their habits daily through notifications
- Users can easily edit, add and delete habits to the list
- Once all the main functionalities are done, I will try to add an achievement system in the app to benefit some users who strive in achievements
- **POST PROD PLAN** For the users to be able to separate the daily habits from habits that are usually done in a specific timeline.

## Version: 0.0.1
